DOCUMENTATION::
> All variables, functions, subroutines, and modules must be documented using Doxygen hooks

> The driver (main) file of each major code unit (pre / post / thor) should contain a more detailed description,
an author   attribution, a timestamp, and a version number

NAMING CONVENTIONS::
>Modules & variables: lowercase /w underscores between words. Wherever possible, avoid abbreviations unless extremely obvious
>Functions & subroutines: camelcase e.g. ThisIsAFunctionName()
